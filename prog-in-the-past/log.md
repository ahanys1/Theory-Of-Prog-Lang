# Programming in the Past Log

### Prediction: This will take me a total of 20 hours to complete the code (Aprox. 4 hours per language)

| Date | Hours Spent | Languages Complete | Tasks/Accomplishments/Issues/Thoughts|
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
|1/17/24| 1 | -1 | finished setting up compiler and environment for Fortran|
|1/19/24| 1.5 | -1 | finished setting up compiler and environment for COBOL|
|1/19/24| 3 | -1 | Why is BASIC so confusing to setup!?|
|1/19/24| 3.25 | -1 |Pascal was so easy in comparison|
|2/08/24|4|0|Gave up on getting Scala working for now, so wrote basic script in JS|
|2/18/24| 4.5 | 0 |I regret not starting this sooner|
|2/18/24| 5| 0 |Screw it using an online IDE for visual BASIC, will just download and put the code in the repo after|
|2/18/24| 5.5 | 0 |This is starting to feel like OS with the late night cramming|
|2/18/24| 7 | 1 |Visual Basic Complete, that wasn't so bad|
|2/18/24| 9 | 1 |why the f**k does fortran have line limits|
|2/19/24| 11 | 2 |Fortran done, I'm done for the night that was rough|
|2/19/24| 13 | 3 |Pascal complete, that wasn't too bad. this is getting repetitive.|
|2/19/24| 15 | 3 |After fiddling around with Scala for 2 hours in both VSC and IntelliJ I am resorting to an online IDE|
|2/19/24| 16 | 4 |Scala: pain in the ass to setup, but really easy to use. Done|
|2/19/24| 19 | 4 |COBOL is a crazy language. found a great video from FreeCodeCamp.org that is helping me though|
|2/19/24| 20 | 4 |Right decided I'm also using an online IDE for COBOL|
|2/19/24| 22 | 4 |this. makes. NO. SENSE.|
|2/20/24| 23 | 4 |Just realized I had the solve function wrong for all languages, fixing now before finishing COBOL|
|2/20/24| 24 | 4 |Solve fixed, added default variable of 25 where possible without too much effort|
|2/20/24| 25 | 4 |giving up on COBOL for now, moving to the report|
